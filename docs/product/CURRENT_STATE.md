# Current State — what is true on `main` today

**Status:** Authoritative (current-state). Maintained by the Project State Steward.
**Reconciled against:** `main` @ `76f5632c4db112c9b4482b6c93800c2caa166c79` (2026-09-04)
**Last edited by:** this reconciliation — PR number not supplied to the run (previous: PR #40)

> **`Reconciled against:` is not the tip of `main`.** It is the last commit at which the

This answers one question: *what is actually true about The Book today?* It is written for
someone joining cold — a new PM or engineer should be able to read this and orient without
reading old chat logs.

Where another document is authoritative, this one **links rather than restates**. A copied
rules section becomes a second source of truth and drifts.

---

## Product

The Book is a **two-sided marketplace for independent service providers and clients**.
A single account can participate as **both** — the same person may book a barber on Tuesday
and take clients as a photographer on Wednesday. **Houston-first.**

The core marketplace loop:

> Discover → Profile → Trust → Book → Pay → Message → Complete → Review → Rebook

**Payments are not live.** This is deliberate: the beta exists to prove the marketplace and
community loop *before* payments (PD-042). See
[HOUSTON_BETA_STRATEGY.md](HOUSTON_BETA_STRATEGY.md).

Product-surface truth — what is REAL vs PARTIAL vs PLACEHOLDER vs DEFERRED vs UNDECIDED —
is authoritative in **[BETA_SCOPE.md](BETA_SCOPE.md)**. Canonical journeys and their
expected end states are authoritative in **[USER_JOURNEYS.md](USER_JOURNEYS.md)**.

---

## Navigation

Authoritative: **[docs/architecture/NAVIGATION.md](../architecture/NAVIGATION.md)**.

Five shared tabs: **Discover · Reels · Bookings · Messages · Me** (`app/(tabs)/`).

There is **no client/provider mode architecture** — no global `currentMode`. Role follows
the domain relationship and capability, not a UI toggle (PD-010). Provider tools live under
**Business** (`app/(tabs)/business/`), not as a parallel tab set (PD-012).

---

## Messaging — pre-booking message requests

Authoritative: **[BETA_SCOPE.md](BETA_SCOPE.md)** § Messaging — it owns the full rules,
including beta specifics this summary does not repeat (a declined request is soft-closed
with non-punitive copy, and the client may send another request later; no cooldown in beta).

Merged and enforced **server-side**, not just in the UI:

- A client may send **one initial message** to a provider they have no booking with.
- The provider **Accepts** or **Declines**.
- While `pending`, further client messages are **blocked**; the provider cannot message until they accept.
- `accepted` opens a normal unified thread for both sides.
- A **booking supersedes** a pending/declined request and reuses the same conversation.
- **Duplicate simultaneous pending** requests for the same pair are prevented by a unique index.
- **One conversation per client/provider pair.**
- `messages.created_at` is **server-stamped**, because it is the pending-cycle boundary — a client cannot back-date to defeat the one-message rule.

Evidence: `supabase/migrations/20260901000000_prebooking_message_requests.sql`,
`20260901010000_prebooking_message_concurrency.sql` (adds a row lock closing a
read-then-insert race on the one-message rule). Regression coverage:
`supabase/tests/messaging.test.sql`.

---

## Reviews — Phase 0 and Phase 1 complete

Full rules are authoritative in **[REVIEWS_MODEL.md](REVIEWS_MODEL.md)**; the locked
decisions behind them are PD-020 … PD-028 in
[PRODUCT_DECISIONS.md](PRODUCT_DECISIONS.md). This section deliberately does **not**
restate them — a third hand-maintained copy would drift, and the qualifiers matter.

Orientation: reviews come only from completed Book bookings, run in **both directions**,
are **1–5 stars with optional text** (a star-only review is valid), have a **7-day
submission window** from the server-authoritative `completed_at`, and stay **blind** until
both sides submit or that window closes. Repeat bookings are independently reviewable;
`under_review` blocks submission and holds reveal; a `no_show` produces no service-quality
review. Structured signals are **Phase 2 — not started**.

> **Read the qualifiers in the source before building on them.** For example, `completed →
> no_show` is rejected *for authenticated writers going forward* — it is a `BEFORE` trigger
> on new writes, `service_role` bypasses it, and pre-existing rows are not remediated.
> `REVIEWS_MODEL.md` states this precisely; a flattened "it can never happen" reading is
> what would justify adding a live-status test to `review_eligible()` and reintroducing the
> suppression vector SEC-DATA-101 closed.

Eligibility is decided by the **server**, not by UI status: `review_opportunity(booking_id,
direction)` and its batch form `review_opportunities(booking_ids[], direction)`. Presentation
grouping (which tab a booking sits in) never decides reviewability.

Migrations: `20260902000000` (Phase 0 foundation), `20260903000000` (opportunity RPC),
`20260904000000` (completed→no_show guard), `20260905000000` (batch RPC).

## Foundation & security

**B5B — permanent executable DB/security regression harness.**

- Asserts real Postgres enforcement — RLS, triggers, grants and `SECURITY DEFINER` behaviour, exercised as the `authenticated` role. The **count changes whenever a suite grows**, so read it from the latest CI run rather than from any document; at run 33726878929 (`e7ccd87`) it was 88/88.
- **Non-production only.** A production-ref guard refuses the production project, the Transaction pooler (port 6543), an `sslmode` that would disable TLS, and any target whose ref cannot be positively identified.
- One transaction, **always rolled back** — zero residue follows from that rollback, not from a per-run emptiness check (the harness performs none; see its README).
- **CI is wired to execute it** via the `db-security` job, which expects the `TEST_SUPABASE_DB_URL` secret. On `push` to `main` a missing secret **fails** the job rather than skipping — a green-and-empty required check proves nothing. On pull requests (including forks, which GitHub withholds secrets from) a missing secret **warns and skips**. Whether the secret is configured *right now* is GitHub state, not repository state — read it from the latest `db-security` run, not from this document.
- The **Session pooler / psql path is verified on `main`**: run 33726878929 on `e7ccd87` logged `via TEST_SUPABASE_DB_URL` and `88/88 passed, 0 failed`.

Docs: **[supabase/tests/README.md](../../supabase/tests/README.md)**.

**Migration ledger.** The repository holds **25 migration files** at `76f5632` — counted from
`supabase/migrations/*.sql`, and that part is repository-provable. That the *remote non-prod
ledger* matches them (`local == remote`, no merged migration edited) was established by
`supabase migration list --linked`: **25 entries** after `20260916000000` was applied to
non-production on 2026-09-05 by an ordinary forward `db push` (no repair). Seven of those
applies — `20260907000000`…`20260913000000` — were **recorded retrospectively** on 2026-09-04,
and the ledger flags that lapse itself. None of this **can be re-proved from repository
state**; a later change made outside this repo would not show up here. Process and the dated
record: **[docs/operations/MIGRATION_LEDGER.md](../operations/MIGRATION_LEDGER.md)**.

**Latest recorded runs.** Rather than restate counts that change with ordinary PRs, this
records *which runs* to look at. Two different things are recorded, and they are not
interchangeable:

- **The last CI run this reconciliation could cite** is **33726878929** on `e7ccd87` —
  `check` and `db-security` both green, the B5B step logging `via TEST_SUPABASE_DB_URL`,
  88/88. At that run: Jest 22 suites / 251 tests, lint 0 errors within the frozen
  `--max-warnings` baseline in `package.json`, typecheck 0 errors. That run is now **many
  merges old** — it pre-dates every barter slice. **No CI run for `76f5632` is cited here**,
  because CI status is GitHub state
  and this reconciliation had no way to query it. Read the latest `check` and `db-security`
  runs directly rather than treating the figures above as current.
- **The last recorded B5B execution** is the post-apply run logged against
  `20260916000000` in
  [MIGRATION_LEDGER.md](../operations/MIGRATION_LEDGER.md) (2026-09-04): **368/368 passed,
  0 failed**, transaction rolled back. That was a local non-prod run, not a CI run.

The suite grew enormously between them — 88 → 367 assertions as the barter slices landed —
which is exactly why the count is read from a run rather than from this document. The
authoritative description of the harness lives in
[supabase/tests/README.md](../../supabase/tests/README.md).

**Why this document's anchor is now `76f5632`.** The previous anchor was `feba568` (Slice 1).
Everything after it changed facts *this document* asserts: the migration chain went from 15
files to 25, the barter surface gained an atomic accept RPC, canonical pair conversations, the
`released` status, Trade Activity and the closed-post guards, and the recorded B5B execution
moved from 138/138 to 368/368. Those are facts asserted above, so the anchor moves to the
commit at which they were verified — PR #47's merge, `76f5632`.

[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) remains authoritative for **which** merge delivered **which**
capability — it carries a Completed row per delivered capability, each citing its merge,
under its own anchor. This document deliberately does not restate that; a second copy would
drift. An anchor is per-document: it moves when that document's own asserted facts move, not
whenever `main` does, which is why this file and `ROADMAP.md` can carry different anchors.

**The Session 4 audit still has no artifact in this repository; Session 5's now does.** The
Slice 1 migration header cites a "Session 4 audit + Session 5 agent review"
(`20260906000000_barter_integrity_slice1.sql:9`) and a plan clause "E-3" (line 36), and the
defect IDs it closes (`SEC-AUTHZ-001`, `SEC-DATA-009`, …) appear nowhere else on `main`. The
**Session 5 output is now committed**: its approved barter clauses are
[BARTER_BETA_CONTRACT.md](BARTER_BETA_CONTRACT.md), and the rulings behind them are PD-043 …
PD-048 (PD-044 records E-3 explicitly). The **Session 4 read-only audit is still not
committed**, so the only in-repo record of it is the migration comment citing it — which means
a cold reader cannot reconstruct why each defect was ranked as it was. That is recorded as a
fact about the repository, not as a criticism of the work.

## Barter — the provider-to-provider trade surface

**Barter is not a blank slate.** [BETA_SCOPE.md](BETA_SCOPE.md) classifies the community /
barter surface as **REAL (beta)** (line 57) — offers, interests and the community screens work.
What was undecided when that classification was written was the barter **product model**: how a
trade binds to bookings, messaging, reviews and completion. For the first Houston closed beta
that model is now locked in **[BARTER_BETA_CONTRACT.md](BARTER_BETA_CONTRACT.md)**, which is
authoritative for it; the decisions behind it are **PD-030 … PD-052** in
[PRODUCT_DECISIONS.md](PRODUCT_DECISIONS.md). Neither is restated here.

This section records only **what is built on `main`** and **what is not**.

### What is on `main`

Verified against the migration chain at `76f5632` — **25 migrations**, newest
`supabase/migrations/20260916000000_barter_guard_admin_escape.sql`.

| Capability | What is actually enforced | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Data model | `barter_offers` and `barter_interests`, and nothing else. **No proposal, agreement or obligation schema exists** — no migration in the chain creates one. | Origin: `20260829000000_canonical_live_baseline.sql` |
| Response vocabulary | `pending → accepted \| declined \| released`, with `released_at`, `released_by` and `release_reason` required together and null together. | `20260909000000_barter_interest_release.sql` (status + completeness check constraints) |
| Write identity | `caller_provider_id()` derives the provider from `auth.uid()`; nothing client-supplied enters the comparison. Foreign-field writes are governed by an **allow-list** trigger, `created_at` is server-stamped, delete guards preserve counterparty history (PD-043), and `anon` holds nothing on either table. | `20260906000000_barter_integrity_slice1.sql` §§ 1–7, 10 |
| Interest rate limit | 15 new interests per provider per rolling 24h, counted from `rate_limit_log` so delete-and-resend cannot reset the window (PD-045). | `20260906000000` § 9 (`enforce_barter_interest_rate_limit`) |
| One negotiation per post | At most one `accepted` response per offer, enforced by a partial unique index and by the accept RPC locking the **offer** row (PD-049). | `20260906000000` § 7; `20260907000000_barter_accept_handoff.sql` |
| Accept | **One atomic RPC**, `accept_barter_interest`: it accepts the response, opens or reuses the pair's conversation and posts the handoff message in a single transaction. Body redefined once, to route the composed message through the sanitiser. | `20260907000000`; redefined by `20260915000000_barter_closed_post_terminal.sql` § 3 |
| Conversation identity | One canonical conversation per provider pair, enforced in the database rather than by client convention. | `20260908000000_canonical_provider_pair.sql` |
| Ending a dead negotiation | `release_barter_interest` moves `accepted → released` and **derives the reason from the caller** (`responder_withdrew` / `owner_ended_negotiation`), so neither party can characterise the other's exit. The counterparty is told by a **server-authored** notice, and message authorship is pinned at the write boundary. | `20260909000000`; `20260910000000_barter_release_signal.sql`; `20260911000000_message_authorship_pin.sql` |
| Durable access | The `my_trade_activity` view (`security_invoker`, `select` to `authenticated` only, revoked from `anon`) backs the route `/community/trade-activity`, so an accepted negotiation stays reachable after its post closes or ages out of the newest-50 discovery feed. | `20260912000000_trade_activity.sql`, hardened by `20260913000000` and `20260914000000` |
| Closed post is terminal | `is_active` is **one-way** for authenticated writers (`enforce_barter_offer_active_one_way`, trigger `barter_offers_zy_active_one_way`), and a closed post's pending responses can be **neither accepted nor declined** (`enforce_barter_answer_open_offer`, trigger `barter_interests_zy_answer_open_offer`). Both raise SQLSTATE `55000`; both exempt `service_role` and the null-`auth.uid()` (no-JWT) path. `released` stays permitted, because a negotiation outlives its post. PD-051, PD-052. | `20260915000000` §§ 1–2, bodies refreshed by `20260916000000` |

**The barter RLS policies are still the Slice 1 set.** `barter_offers_provider_read` and
`barter_interests_offer_owner_read` on reads; `barter_offers_provider_insert`,
`barter_offers_owner_update`, `barter_offers_owner_delete`, `barter_interests_provider_insert`,
`barter_interests_owner_update`, `barter_interests_own_delete` on writes. No migration after
`20260906000000` creates or drops a policy on either table — every rule added since is a trigger
or an RPC, which is why a policy-level reading of this surface is now incomplete on its own.

**Client surfaces.** `lib/barter.ts` is the data layer; `lib/tradeActivity.ts` holds the
per-row capability and copy rules (`tradeRowState`) that **both** barter surfaces consume, and
`lib/barterErrors.ts` interprets the server's refusals. Screens: `app/community/index.tsx`
(feed), `barter-compose.tsx`, `barter-interests.tsx` (an offer's responses) and
`trade-activity.tsx`. Interest counts are shown to the **offer owner only**
(`app/community/index.tsx`, the `isOwner` branch), which is what
[BARTER_BETA_CONTRACT.md](BARTER_BETA_CONTRACT.md) § 10 requires.

Regression coverage: `supabase/tests/barter.test.sql`, registered in the B5B runner at
`scripts/db-security-test.mjs`, plus `__tests__/lib/tradeActivity.test.ts` for the pure client
rules. The last recorded execution of the whole B5B suite is **368/368 passed, 0 failed** —
see § Foundation & security above for what that figure does and does not establish.

### What is not built

**[BARTER_BETA_CONTRACT.md](BARTER_BETA_CONTRACT.md) § 12 is the authoritative gap list** and is
not copied here. Two gaps matter most to anyone reading this document cold:

- **There is no agreement or obligation schema.** PD-046 (cancellation / no-show), PD-047
  (proposal snapshots) and § 4/§ 6 of the contract describe a trade model that has **no tables
  behind it**. Everything above is the *pre-agreement* negotiation surface.
- **Offer creation is not server-limited.** The interest cap is server-authoritative; the
  offers-per-day cap is client-side only and its check fails open
  ([BARTER_BETA_CONTRACT.md](BARTER_BETA_CONTRACT.md) § 10, `lib/rateLimit.ts`).

Also unbuilt: the `is_approved` **eligibility conjunct** (PD-044 — `caller_provider_id()`
deliberately carries the seam without the condition, `20260906000000:145`), the **Open to
Trades** opt-in, and the post-decline reverse-contact episode (PD-048).

**Which merge delivered which capability is [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)'s record**, not this
document's — it carries a Completed row per delivered capability, each citing its evidence.

Open barter questions: **OQ-006** (collusion / reciprocal-rating gaming) and **OQ-007** (what in
the pre-existing implementation is salvageable) remain **Open**. OQ-001 … OQ-005 and OQ-008 are
closed, each citing the decision that closed it, in
[OPEN_QUESTIONS.md](OPEN_QUESTIONS.md). A migration is an implementation, not an approval, and
none of the work above closes a question by itself.

## Agents

Four agents, defined in `.agents/` with thin Claude Code adapters in `.claude/agents/`:

| # | Agent | Access |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | QA / Journey Reviewer | read-only |
| 2 | Security Reviewer | read-only |
| 3 | Codebase Auditor | read-only |
| 4 | **Project State Steward** | read + writes limited to 5 PM docs |

---

## What is deliberately NOT built

Recorded so absence is not mistaken for oversight:

- **Payments** — PLACEHOLDER/FUTURE; after the beta (PD-042).
- **Reviews Phase 2** — structured signals, reliability/conduct reputation, no-show scoring.
- **Delayed-deliverable reviews** — `delivered_at`, category-specific windows.
- **Safety operations** — masked comms, check-in/out, escalation, evidence preservation.
- **Identity verification enforcement** — messaging is educational during beta (PD-004).

---

## What this document cannot tell you

Written from repository state at rest. It does **not** establish: runtime behaviour on a
device, whether the app currently builds for release, live production state (explicitly out
of scope), or anything about real user behaviour. Where a claim needed a run to confirm, it
cites the recorded run rather than asserting it fresh.

**One caveat about how this revision was verified.** The reconciliation that produced it read
the working tree at `871eb2a` — `main` @ `76f5632` plus one unmerged commit on
`chore/pre-proposal-closeout` that touches **barter client code**. The migration chain was
confirmed to be `main`'s (25 files, newest `20260916000000`), so every server-enforced claim
above is anchored to `main`. Client-side citations name a **file and symbol rather than a line
number**, because that one commit can move lines this document does not own.
